# AnimatedWizardSample

Hey ide guys , I've extracted the oomph beautiful wizard to a plugin for our future ui of code upgrade tool , you can clone my repo and import it into eclipse and debug it.
Go to Menu->AnimatedWizardSample->AnimatedWizardSample and you will see the result.


##Following is the effect screen shot

##Now we can move the dialog in to a eclipse view part.

##And I've extracted the gear into a composite with the animate effect. You run main method in GearControl.java to see the effect.
